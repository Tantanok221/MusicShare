<p class="sm px-2">The first installment in my massive progressive rock listening list, which hopes to provide an outline of what constitutes a "comprehensive" prog rock collection. This particular list covers "classic era" Progressive Rock, and is restricted to bands who released their most significant work during the prog rock heyday of the late-60's through the late-70's. For prog rock artists who didn't begin releasing albums after that time, see my accompanying Modern Progressive Rock. I've also omitted most artists who are more commonly associated with the Krautrock movement, the jazz rock scene, or with the avant-prog/Rock In Opposition movements. </p>
